A collage tool for creating "internet art" on the canvas element with ease. Built in javascript, ruby and sinatra. Uses ruby's open-uri wrapper and a clever little hack to get past CORS restrictions, allowing the user to upload images from any source and download the final product as a png. No jquery, no rails, no libraries, no gems.

TO DO:

Fix scaling - currently breaks over a certain size and under 1.

Improve UI!
